                        <p>Hello! I'm Branden, an Electrical Engineering Undergraduate Student at the University 
                            of Waterloo. For as long as I can remember, I have been interested in computers and technology, 
                            and that's why I have decided to pursue that passion through a fulfilling career. </p>

                        <p>Since my first experience with robotics in seventh grade, I was hooked, and from that point on I continued to learn more about my passion of computers and robotics. In the past, I taught children robotics and programming, worked as a part of engineering teams, and independently learned new technologies and applied them to my personal projects. Currently, Iâ€™m pursuing my passions through the Electrical Engineering program at the University of Waterloo and through co-op experiences.</p>

                        <p>Pioneered development of a call classification model for a real-time communications analytics platform to improve the speed of classification of calls, prevent network congestion, and decrease customer annoyance. Extracted features from customer calling records using the EDA process and generated visualizations with Python, providing features for the call classification model and allowing the customer to understand network issues. Corrected bugs in existing ML algorithm, allowing the project to be reliably demoed to clients and leadership team. Mentored high school intern in various aspects of software development, including practical AI/ML R&amp;D.</p>

                        <h4>Software Developer</h4>
                        <p>As a front-end developer, I implemented new features and improved existing components of an 
                            Angular application. I designed application components to integrate into the existing user 
                            interface, ensuring a seamless user experience. I had the opportunity to completely redesign a page of the application to create 
                            a more intuitive UX. I also reviewing code and advised my team on automated testing suite architecture and best practices.</p>

                        <p>Throughout my term at Connected, one of my main responsibilities was to design and develop an 
                            automated testing suite to verify the quality of the software we were producing. I also had 
                            the opportunity to present the progress for the sprint and demoed development work for client 
                            meetings and company demos. I communicated with the lead developer and project managers to give 
                            project updates. I was also exposed to the agile development process and validated features in 
                            an agile iterative manner.</p>

                <p>I completed the deeplearning.ai Deep Learning specialization provided through Coursera. The course taught the foundation
                    of deep learning as well as best practices. It also covered multiple network architectures and their applications. I implemented course
                    concepts through multiple practical projects, such as face recognition and machine translation.

                <h3>Connected Co-op Project</h3>
                <p>Throughout my co-op term at Connected, I collaborated with six other co-ops to develop an Android 
                App in Kotlin. The app was intended as a tool used by speakers to help prepare for presentations, by 
                analyzing their speech and giving metrics of their performance.</p>
